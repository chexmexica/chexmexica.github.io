## About Me
### My Interests
 I like hiking, working out, playing video games, watching movies and TV shows, and hanging out with my friends.  
 I graduated from NC State last semester with a BS in Microbiology and Food/Brewing Chemistry, and I'm currently working on a Data Science Associate's at Wake Tech while I wait to start my MS in Biostatistics or Biomedical Engineering. I'm hoping to go to Duke University for my MS, but I'm applying to NC State, Virginia Tech, and MIT.
