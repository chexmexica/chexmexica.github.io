## About Me
 My name is Jeff, and I'm 29 years old. I was born in Durham, NC, and I've lived most my life here. After high school I joined the Marine Corps and served for 4 years, 2 of which I lived in Japan. After I got out, I decided to go to NC State University.
 I graduated last semester with a BS in Microbiology and Food/Brewing Chemistry, and I'm currently working on a Data Science Associate's at Wake Tech while I wait to start my MS in Biostatistics or Biomedical Engineering. I'm hoping to go to Duke University for my MS, but I'm applying to NC State, Virginia Tech, and MIT.
### My Interests
 I like hiking, working out, playing video games, watching movies and TV shows, shooting guns, and hanging out with my friends.  
 While I was at NC State, I took a handful of Computer Science electives, and became interested in Data Science and coding. I'd like to learn Python and R because I think they work well with scraping and interpreting data, and I think they'd be useful in Biostatistics.

### Websites I recommend
 * [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) - PubChem is run by the National Institute of Health and is a really good site for researching and referencing chemicals used in experiments.  
 * [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/) - ScienceDirect an extensive database for scientific studies. It is useful for accessing studies for research and experimental design.
